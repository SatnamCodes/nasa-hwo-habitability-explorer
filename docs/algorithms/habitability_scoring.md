# Habitability Scoring Algorithms

## Overview

The HWO Habitability Explorer implements sophisticated algorithms for assessing exoplanet habitability based on established astrobiological criteria and observational constraints. Our scoring system integrates multiple scientific methodologies to provide comprehensive habitability assessments.

## Scientific Foundation

### Habitable Zone Theory

The concept of the habitable zone (HZ), also known as the "Goldwater zone," defines the orbital region around a star where liquid water could exist on a planet's surface. Our implementation considers:

**Conservative Habitable Zone (CHZ):**
- Inner boundary: Runaway greenhouse limit
- Outer boundary: Maximum greenhouse effect
- Based on radiative-convective climate models

**Optimistic Habitable Zone (OHZ):**
- Extended boundaries considering atmospheric retention
- Cloud feedback mechanisms
- Enhanced greenhouse effects from CO₂ and other gases

### Planetary Biosignature Detection

Our algorithms evaluate potential biosignatures in exoplanet atmospheres:

**Primary Biosignatures:**
- **Water Vapor (H₂O)**: Essential for liquid water existence
- **Oxygen (O₂)**: Strong indicator of photosynthetic activity
- **Ozone (O₃)**: Secondary indicator of atmospheric oxygen
- **Methane (CH₄)**: Potential indicator of biological activity

**Contextual Analysis:**
- False positive screening for abiotic oxygen production
- Methane-oxygen disequilibrium detection
- Atmospheric escape modeling for different stellar environments

## CDHS Algorithm Implementation

### Core Criteria for Detectability of Habitable Systems (CDHS)

The CDHS algorithm evaluates exoplanets based on NASA HWO mission requirements:

```python
def cdhs_score(planet_data):
    """
    Calculate CDHS habitability score
    
    Parameters:
    - stellar_type: Host star classification
    - planet_radius: Planetary radius in Earth radii
    - orbital_period: Orbital period in days
    - stellar_distance: Distance to host star in parsecs
    - atmospheric_features: Available spectroscopic data
    """
    
    # Habitable zone assessment
    hz_score = calculate_habitable_zone_position(planet_data)
    
    # Size constraints for terrestrial planets
    size_score = evaluate_planetary_size(planet_data.radius)
    
    # Detectability with HWO instruments
    detectability_score = assess_hwo_detectability(planet_data)
    
    # Atmospheric characterization potential
    atmosphere_score = evaluate_atmospheric_potential(planet_data)
    
    # Weighted composite score
    cdhs_score = (
        hz_score * 0.3 +
        size_score * 0.25 +
        detectability_score * 0.25 +
        atmosphere_score * 0.2
    )
    
    return cdhs_score
```
