## Scientific Methodology and Accuracy

### Q: What scientific criteria define the "habitable zone"?
**A:** The habitable zone calculation incorporates multiple research-validated definitions:

**Conservative Habitable Zone (CHZ):**
- Inner boundary: Runaway greenhouse limit where water vapor dominates atmospheric heating
- Outer boundary: Maximum greenhouse effect where CO₂ condensation prevents surface warming
- Based on 1D radiative-convective climate models validated against Venus and Mars

**Optimistic Habitable Zone (OHZ):**
- Extended boundaries considering enhanced greenhouse effects from atmospheric composition
- Cloud feedback mechanisms and atmospheric circulation patterns
- Tidal heating effects for tidally locked planets around M-dwarf stars

**Recent Venus/Early Mars Boundaries:**
- Incorporates lessons from Solar System planetary evolution
- Water loss mechanisms through hydrodynamic escape
- Long-term atmospheric evolution and stability considerations

### Q: How do you account for different stellar types in habitability assessments?
**A:** Stellar characteristics fundamentally impact habitability through multiple mechanisms:

**G-Type Stars (Sun-like, 5200-6000K):**
- Stable luminosity evolution over 10+ billion year main sequence lifetimes
- Optimal UV flux for atmospheric photochemistry without excessive atmospheric escape
- Well-constrained stellar evolution models and age determination methods

**K-Type Stars (Orange dwarfs, 3700-5200K):**
- Extended main sequence lifetimes (20-70 billion years) providing stable conditions
- Lower UV flux reduces atmospheric erosion and enhances atmospheric retention
- Narrower habitable zones but potentially more stable long-term environments

**M-Type Stars (Red dwarfs, 2400-3700K):**
- Extremely long lifetimes (>100 billion years) but complex early evolution
- High flare activity during first billion years affects atmospheric chemistry
- Tidal locking considerations requiring atmospheric circulation modeling
- Enhanced greenhouse requirements due to lower stellar temperatures

### Q: What biosignatures does the system evaluate and why?
**A:** The platform assesses a comprehensive suite of atmospheric biosignatures based on current astrobiology research:

**Primary Biosignatures (Strong Life Indicators):**
